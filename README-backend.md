# Blue Ivory Group Software Engineer Challenge - Backend
## Introduction
Create a simple Blackjack API using NodeJS and MongoDB

​
## Requirements
###  Game functionalities we like to see 
- Create the MongoDB database Schema
- Create a route to initiate the game, with a deck of 3 packs of cards (52x3), containing the data for each card
- Create a route to draw cards to players from current deck
- Create a route to draw cards to Dealer using a hand evaluation algorithm from current deck
- Create a route to get the score for a given hand. 
- Create a route to save the state after each rounds
- Create a route to get the history for a given player

Please note that we are not necessarily expecting you to build all requirements. Build as much as you can.

### Bonus:
- ES6+
- Type checking (Typescript…)
- mongo-unit

​### Other
1. Instructions on starting your application
2. Use git
3. Test cases (at least unit tests for major functions)
4. Instructions on creating a production build
​

## Submission
### **!!!!Important!!!!**
If you submit as a public git repository:
- `Avoid words like “Blue Ivory Group” and “challenge” in your repository.`
- `Do not copy any part of this file`  

Alternatively, you may also send us a ZIP archive file containing your solution. For fairness’ sake, you must also use Git and include the `.git` directory in the archive if you submit a ZIP archive file.

If you are so inclined, you can deploy the application onto a remote server (e.g. heroku) in addition to sending us your Git repository.
